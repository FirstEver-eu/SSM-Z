# SSM-Z (Super Sampling Manager)

SSM-Z is a versatile freeware tool designed for gamers and PC enthusiasts to manage and optimize AI-driven super sampling technologies, such as AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), Intel XeSS, and NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). The program supports Windows 10 version 2004 (10.0.19041) or newer and enables seamless updates and management of relevant libraries.
